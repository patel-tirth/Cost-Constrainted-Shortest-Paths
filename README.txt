The worksheet is inside the src directory with name "worksheet.pdf".
A file cpath.cpp is added in the src folder provided by professor Lillis. 
This cpath.cpp file calls the cpath function in Graph.h .
The cpath function takes source, destination and budget as parameters and returns :

1) The entire trade off curve of (cost, time) pairs of non dominated paths from source to destination

2) Fastest way to go from source to destination within the budget specified. 

3) The path from source to destination

To run the program, open the src directory in terminal follow the below commands in the terminal

-> make 
-> ./cpath <filename> <src> <dest> <budget>         (example:  ./cpath g2.g 2 6 7)
-> The output will be shown as specifed above.
